## RAWDATA Portfolio Project

The project portfolio includes three subprojects that will relate to areas covered in four corresponding sections of the RAWDATA course. The task in the project portfolio is to create a Stack Overflow Viewer 
Application (SOVA). The primary aim is to provide functionality for searching information in the data extracted from Stack Overflow. This involves keyword based search to access information, as well as some means of tracking of personal use, like search history, marking of found solutions, etc.
